# Bouncing-Ball
Creating a bouncing ball simulation in Java is a common exercise to understand graphics, animation, and physics in programming.
Key Concepts
Graphics and Painting: We'll use JPanel for custom painting and JFrame to create the window.
Animation: This involves updating the position of the ball at regular intervals and redrawing it.
Physics: Basic physics to simulate gravity and collision with the walls.
Step-by-Step Implementation
1. Setup the Project
Ensure you have a Java development environment set up. Create a new Java project and a class for the main application.

2. Create the Main Class
This will set up the frame and start the animation.
